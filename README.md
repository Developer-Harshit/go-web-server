# Go Web Server

This repo can be used as a starting point to deploy [Go](https://golang.org/) web applications on Render.

It is a Dockerized version of the [realtime chat](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/tree/master/examples/realtime-advanced) example powered by the [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) web framework.

The sample app is up at https://go-web.app.render.com.
